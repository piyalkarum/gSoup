## gSoup: An R package to perform various genetic analyses
`r gSoup:::colorize("Piyal Karunarathne","dodgerblue")`

I wrote this package to assemble all essential bioinformatic tools in one place because I was tired of having to switch between different platforms to perform basic (and advance) population genetics and molecular evolution analyses. Whatever I find useful I will add to the package; hence it's a SOUP. If you have any tools, analyses, plottings, or anyother tool you like to use in R, let me know. I will add it. Let's make this an ALL-IN-ONE package.

Here is a plot I created with the package.

***A tutorial of functions in the package will be up soon***
